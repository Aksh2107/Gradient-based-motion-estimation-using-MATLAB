# Gradient-based-motion-estimation-using-MATLAB
Motion estimation is the process of determining motion vectors that describe the transformation from one 2D image to another; usually from adjacent frames in a video sequence. It is an ill-posed problem as the motion is in three dimensions but the images are a projection of the 3D scene onto a 2D plane.


Gradient based motion estimation is more precisely called 'motion estimation based on an equation with boundary conditions' and is based on a partial differential equation supported the spatial and temporal image gradients related to that of movement puts.
